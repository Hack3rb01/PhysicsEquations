  /**
   * One of the equations of motion in physics is VVff 2 = VVii 2 + 2ad 
   * where VVff is the final velocity of an object (mm/ss), VVii is its initial 
   * velocity (mm/ss), aa is its acceleration (mm/ss2) and dd is the 
   * distance it travels (mm). So this formula allows you to calculate how fast
   * an object is going at an ending point if you know what speed it began at,
   * the distance from the starting to the ending point and the (constant)
   * acceleration from the starting to the ending point. Use this formula to
   * compute the final velocity of an object given the other three values. Have
   * your program prompt the user to input the initial velocity VVii, the 
   * acceleration aa, and the distance dd as decimal numbers. The program 
   * will then calculate and display the final velocity VVff in a prompt.
